# Thx Social App
A full stack social media web app created using Python - Django, HTML, CSS - Tailwind and Javascript - JQuery.

The homepage or feed page in this example is used as a Gratitude Board where different users can post messages, upload pictures, view and interact with others' posts using 'likes' ‚ù§Ô∏è and the comments functionality. 
This homepage can be a generic homepage for all posts or customized depending on the determined purpose & users of the social media app. <br>
‚úçÔ∏è Users can create their own accounts & manage their profiles, scroll through media and text blocks, and filter created posts by user. <br>
üìîThere is also a separate feed or view for users who want to use it more like a journal, where it only shows their own posts, and no social input with comments from others filtered out. <br>


Possible use case: Addition to an internal webapp for an organization or company, added feature for an existing web app without any social features to enable interaction between users

This social media app can serve several purposes for an organization:
- User engagement and relationship management through direct interaction, as a platform that enables communication & feedback
- Foster a sense of community within the organization
- Facilitate communication and information sharing among employees
- Enable collaboration on projects and tasks
- Showcase the organization's culture and values
- Monitor user behavior, preferences, trends
- Gain insights into user sentiment & optinions
- Analyze & monitor user sentiment and respond accordingly
- Address concerns and manage reputation during crises
- Disseminate official statements and updates


Possible future improvements: 
Enable 'share' & hashtag functionality, improved user profiles system with follow/unfollow, implement algorithms to suggest content, users, and pages based on interests & improved user profiles
